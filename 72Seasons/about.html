                <p>Hello! Thanks for checking out my 72Seasons Blog! I've always been fascinated with Japanese culture and I love slowing down and taking in nature. So, I'm using this blog to explore the traditional Japanese calendar that divides the year into seventy-two subtle shifts. Each post reflects on the natural signs and cultural notes of these fleeting moments.</p>
                <p>Sometimes, I might describe what I'm experiencing or what the weather in Japan is currently. I started this blog to slow down, observe the world more closely, and share the beauty I find in these seasonal changes. I also want this to be a jumping off point for more research and rabbit holes. Hopefully you will learn something, or at least enjoy reading a short haiku.</p>
                <p>As a quick disclaimer, I am using Generative AI tools to help me write and edit. I completely understand if you want to stop reading and click away. Using these tools keeps me from burning out and actually producing something longer than a single post. Hoping that you will enjoy this blog as much as I have putting it together. Enjoy!</p>

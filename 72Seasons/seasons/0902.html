          The rice fields bow under the weight of ripening grain. Stalks that stood sharp and green through summer now turn a soft
          gold, the heads heavy and full. Each breath of wind sends the paddies into slow motion, a tide of grain ready for the
          sickle.

          <em>禾乃登</em> (<em>Kokumono sunawachi minoru</em>) signals the beginning of <em>Hakuro</em>, or White Dew. It is the moment
          when rice—long the measure of a good year—reaches maturity. Farmers test the grains between their fingers, watching for
          the precise day to drain the fields and begin the harvest.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Japan, the rice plant's turn toward gold has marked the calendar for centuries. The timing of the harvest once shaped
          village rhythms, festivals, and even taxes. Modern machinery has eased the labor, but the first cut of the season still
          carries a note of ceremony and relief.
        </p>
        <p>
          Botanically, the drooping heads tell a simple story: starch has filled the grains, moisture drops, and the plant lets the
          weight pull it earthward. That bow is a promise of sustenance, a year’s work gathered in each cluster.
        </p>
        <p>
          Standing beside a field at this time feels like holding one long breath. The season is about to turn, yet this moment—
          poised between growing and gathering—is its own kind of stillness.

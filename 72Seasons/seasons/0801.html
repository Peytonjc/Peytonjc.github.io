          The horizon darkens and the air holds its breath. Heat lies heavy over the fields, yet somewhere beyond, thunderheads build. The earth seems to wait, thirsty for the rush of water that could come at any moment.

          <em>Taiu tokidoki furu</em> (Heavy rain may fall) closes out the season of Greater Heat. In Japan, early August is prime time for sudden downpours and <a href="https://www.japan.go.jp/kizuna/2022/07/guerilla_heavy_rain.html">“guerilla rainstorms”</a> that can drop inches of water in minutes. Tokyo alone averages <a href="https://weatherspark.com/y/143809/Average-Weather-in-Tokyo-Japan-Year-Round#Figures-Rainfall">over six inches of rain</a> in August, much of it arriving in quick bursts.
        </p>

          Rice paddies swell with these showers. The water refreshes tired stalks but too much weight can topple them, so farmers watch the sky and brace their fields. The same rains that soothe the soil can carve gullies and flood valleys in a single afternoon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Storms like these call to mind Susanoo-no-Mikoto, the storm god whose tempests once slew the eight-headed serpent <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Susanoo">Yamata no Orochi</a>. His gales could devastate, yet they also cleared the way for rivers to run and crops to grow.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the torrents finally fall, they scrub the heat from the air and leave everything shimmering. Let this brief deluge wash away what has clung through summer's long humidity. Autumn waits just beyond the clouds.
